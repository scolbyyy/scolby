<h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
<div class = "section">
	<p>An avid lifelong writer, I am fueled by my passion for the power stories have to connect us to each other. I have experience with several forms and styles — screenwriting is my particular focus.</p>
	<br>
	<p>I am a junior pursuing a double major BA from Oberlin College in Cinema Studies and Creative Writing with minors in Creative Technologies and Music. On campus, I work as an admissions tour guide as well as a research assistant in the Crafting Sound Lab within Oberlin Conservatory's department of Technology in Music and Related Arts.</p>
	<br>
	<p>I love incorporating new technology into my storytelling and musical practice. I am comfortable with a wide variety of software, including Logic, Reaper, Sibelius, and Final Cut. I also code in HTML, CSS, Java, and Python.</p>
	<br>
	<p>I have a theater background, volunteering for Live Arts Theater in Charlottesville, Virginia as a script reviewer, editor, and dramaturge. I also acted in director Janet Adderley's Santa Barbara Youth Ensemble Theater troupe.</p>
	<br>
	<p>I grew up in Livermore and Santa Barbara, California, and I'm currently based in Charlottesville, Virginia. I am Venezuelan-American.</p>
	<br>
	<p>In between writing workshops, film screenings, and organ practice, you can find me cooking an overly ambitious meal.</p>
